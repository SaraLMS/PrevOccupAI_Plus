Functions to load, filter, and organize sensor acquisition file paths from multiple devices.

Available Functions
-------------------
[Public]
get_sensor_paths_per_device(...): Load, filter, and organize sensor file paths for phone, watch, and MBAN devices into a nested dictionary grouped by acquisition times.
-------------------

[Private]
_get_device_files(...): Collect file paths for a given device. For phone/watch, filters by selected sensors; for MBAN, loads all files.
_keep_largest_file_per_acquisition(...): For each acquisition time, keep only the largest file (used for MBAN data).
_filter_mban_files(...): Replace the "mban" entry with "mban_left" and "mban_right" entries, splitting by MAC address.
_group_mban_files(...): Split MBAN files into left/right groups based on MAC address and metadata.
_get_android_filepaths(...): Retrieve phone or watch sensor file paths from the folder, filtering by the requested sensors.
_get_mban_files(...): Get all MBAN files from the folder using MAC address pattern matching.
_get_file_by_sensor(...): Find and return the file corresponding to a given sensor name.
_group_files_by_acquisition(...): Group files by their acquisition folder (immediate parent folder, e.g., '10-20-00').

def get_sensor_paths_per_device(folder_path: str, load_devices: Dict[str, List[str]]):
    """
    Load, filter, and organize sensor file paths for multiple devices into a nested dictionary.

    This function does the following:
      (1). Load all file paths from the input `folder_path`, grouped by device type.

         - For phone and watch devices, loads only the sensors defined in load_devices.
         - For MBAN devices, load all MBAN files (from both left and right mbans).

      (1.1). If MBAN is to be loaded, split its files into separate sides ('mban_left', 'mban_right').

      (2). Group the collected file paths by acquisition time (folder names with the format hh-mm-ss).

      (2.1). For the MBAN, keep only the largest file for each acquisition.

    Final Output:
      Returns a nested dictionary in the form:
